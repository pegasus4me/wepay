It is required to be equal to the request signer.\n * * `to`: The address that should be called.\n * * `value`: The amount of native token to attach with the requested call.\n * * `gas`: The amount of gas limit that will be forwarded with the requested call.\n * * `nonce`: A unique transaction ordering identifier to avoid replayability and request invalidation.\n * * `deadline`: A timestamp after which the request is not executable anymore.\n * * `data`: Encoded `msg.data` to send with the requested call.\n *\n * Relayers are able to submit batches if they are processing a high volume of requests. With high\n * throughput, relayers may run into limitations of the chain such as limits on the number of\n * transactions in the mempool.

Often, the relayer is operated by a project that will consider it a user\n * acquisition cost.\n *\n * By offering to pay for gas, relayers are at risk of having that gas used by an attacker toward\n * some other purpose that is not aligned with the expected out of band incentives. If you operate a\n * relayer, consider whitelisting target contracts and function selectors. When relaying ERC-721 or\n * ERC-1155 transfers specifically, consider rejecting the use of the `data` field, since it can be\n * used to execute arbitrary code.\n */\ncontract ERC2771Forwarder is EIP712, Nonces {\n    using ECDSA for bytes32;\n\n    struct ForwardRequestData {\n        address from;\n        address to;\n        uint256 value;\n        uint256 gas;\n        uint48 deadline;\n        bytes data;\n        bytes signature;\n    }\n\n    bytes32 internal constant _FORWARD_REQUEST_TYPEHASH =\n        keccak256(\n            \"ForwardRequest(address from,address to,uint256 value,uint256 gas,uint256 nonce,uint48 deadline,bytes data)\"\n        );\n\n    /**\n     * @dev Emitted when a `ForwardRequest` is executed.\n     *\n     * NOTE: An unsuccessful forward request could be due to an invalid signature, an expired deadline,\n     * or simply a revert in the requested call.

@dev A forwarder compatible with ERC-2771 contracts. See {ERC2771Context}.\n This forwarder operates on forward requests that include:\n * `from`: An address to operate on behalf of. It is required to be equal to the request signer.\n * `to`: The address that should be called.\n * `value`: The amount of native token to attach with the requested call.\n * `gas`: The amount of gas limit that will be forwarded with the requested call.\n * `nonce`: A unique transaction ordering identifier to avoid replayability and request invalidation.\n * `deadline`: A timestamp after which the request is not executable anymore.\n * `data`: Encoded `msg.data` to send with the requested call.\n Relayers are able to submit batches if they are processing a high volume of requests. With high\n throughput, relayers may run into limitations of the chain such as limits on the number of\n transactions in the mempool. In these cases the recommendation is to distribute the load among\n multiple accounts.\n NOTE: Batching requests includes an optional refund for unused `msg.value` that is achieved by\n performing a call with empty calldata. While this is within the bounds of ERC-2771 compliance,\n if the refund receiver happens to consider the forwarder a trusted forwarder, it MUST properly\n handle `msg.data.length == 0`. `ERC2771Context` in OpenZeppelin Contracts versions prior to 4.9.3\n do not handle this properly.\n ==== Security Considerations\n If a relayer submits a forward request, it should be willing to pay up to 100% of the gas amount\n specified in the request. This contract does not implement any kind of retribution for this gas,\n and it is assumed that there is an out of band incentive for relayers to pay for execution on\n behalf of signers. Often, the relayer is operated by a project that will consider it a user\n acquisition cost.\n By offering to pay for gas, relayers are at risk of having that gas used by an attacker toward\n some other purpose that is not aligned with the expected out of band incentives. If you operate a\n relayer, consider whitelisting target contracts and function selectors. When relaying ERC-721 or\n ERC-1155 transfers specifically, consider rejecting the use of the `data` field, since it can be\n used to execute arbitrary

@dev https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-712[EIP-712] is a standard for hashing and signing of typed structured data.\n The encoding scheme specified in the EIP requires a domain separator and a hash

Protocols need to implement the type-specific encoding they need in order to\n produce the hash of their typed data using a combination of `abi.encode` and `keccak256`.\n This contract implements the EIP-712 domain separator ({_domainSeparatorV4}) that is used as part of the encoding\n scheme, and the final step of the encoding to obtain the message digest that is then signed via ECDSA\n ({_hashTypedDataV4}).\n The implementation of the domain separator was designed to be as efficient as possible while still properly updating\n the chain id to protect against replay attacks on an eventual fork of the chain.\n NOTE: This contract implements the version of the encoding known as \"v4\", as implemented by the JSON RPC method\n https://docs.metamask.io/guide/signing-data.html[`eth_signTypedDataV4` in MetaMask].\n NOTE: In the upgradeable version of this contract, the cached values will correspond to the address, and the domain\n separator of the implementation contract. This will cause the {_domainSeparatorV4} function to always rebuild the\n separator from the immutable values, which is cheaper than accessing a cached version in cold storage.\n

@dev Calculate the modular multiplicative inverse of a number in Z/nZ.\n If n is a prime, then Z/nZ is a field. In that case all elements are inversible, except 0.\n If n is not a prime, then Z/nZ is not a field, and some elements might not be inversible.\n If the input value is not inversible, 0 is returned.\n NOTE: If you know for sure that n is (big) a prime, it may be cheaper to use Fermat's little theorem and get the\n inverse using `Math.modExp(a, n - 2, n)`.

forwarder compatible with ERC-2771 contracts. See {ERC2771Context}. This forwarder operates on forward requests that include: * `from`: An address to operate on behalf of. It is required to be equal to the request signer. * `to`: The address that should be called. * `value`: The amount of native token to attach with the requested call. * `gas`: The amount of gas limit that will be forwarded with the requested call. * `nonce`: A unique transaction ordering identifier to avoid replayability and request invalidation. * `deadline`: A timestamp after which the request is not executable anymore. * `data`: Encoded `msg.data` to send with the requested call. Relayers are able to submit batches if they are processing a high volume of requests. With high throughput, relayers may run into limitations of the chain such as limits on the number of transactions in the mempool. In these cases the recommendation is to distribute the load among multiple accounts. NOTE: Batching requests includes an optional refund for unused `msg.value` that is achieved by performing a call with empty calldata. While this is within the bounds of ERC-2771 compliance, if the refund receiver happens to consider the forwarder a trusted forwarder, it MUST properly handle `msg.data.length == 0`. `ERC2771Context` in OpenZeppelin Contracts versions prior to 4.9.3 do not handle this properly. ==== Security Considerations If a relayer submits a forward request, it should be willing to pay up to 100% of the gas amount specified in the request. This contract does not implement any kind of retribution for this gas, and it is assumed that there is an out of band incentive for relayers to pay for execution on behalf of signers. Often, the relayer is operated by a project that will consider it a user acquisition cost. By offering to pay for gas, relayers are at risk of having that gas used by an attacker toward some other purpose that is not aligned with the expected out of band incentives. If you operate a relayer, consider whitelisting target contracts and function selectors. When relaying ERC-721 or ERC-1155 transfers specifically, consider rejecting the use of the `data` field, since it can be used to execute arbitrary code.\",\"errors\":{\"ERC2771ForwarderExpiredRequest(uint48)\":[{\"details\":\"The request `deadline` has expired.\"}],\"ERC2771ForwarderInvalidSigner(address,address)\":[{\"details\":\"The request `from` doesn't match with the recovered `signer`.\"}],\"ERC2771ForwarderMismatchedValue(uint256,uint256)\":[{\"details\":\"The `requestedValue` doesn't match with the available `msgValue`.\"}],\"ERC2771UntrustfulTarget(address,address)\":[{\"details\":\"The request target doesn't trust the `forwarder`.\"}],\"FailedCall()\":[{\"details\":\"A call to an address target failed.

Protocols need to implement the type-specific encoding they need in order to produce the hash of their typed data using a combination of `abi.encode` and `keccak256`. This contract implements the EIP-712 domain separator ({_domainSeparatorV4}) that is used as part of the encoding scheme, and the final step of the encoding to obtain the message digest that is then signed via ECDSA ({_hashTypedDataV4}). The implementation of the domain separator was designed to be as efficient as possible while still properly updating the chain id to protect against replay attacks on an eventual fork of the chain. NOTE: This contract implements the version of the encoding known as \\\"v4\\\", as implemented by the JSON RPC method https://docs.metamask.io/guide/signing-data.html[`eth_signTypedDataV4` in MetaMask]. NOTE: In the upgradeable version of this contract, the cached values will correspond to the address, and the domain separator of the implementation contract.
